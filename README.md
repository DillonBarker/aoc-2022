              \) /  o o  \ (/
                '_   Â¬   _'

## How to use

To run all days:
```
cargo run all
```

To run a day:
```
cargo run 1
```

To run the tests:
```
cargo test
```

## Scripts

To start a day:
```
./scripts/begin_day.sh
```
Then input the day you want to create in `./src/days`
```
day_2
```
This will create a file in `./src/days/day_2.rs` and populate it with some starting code.

## Todo
- simplify structure, dont think pub mod all days in the days.rs is very good
- add compilation times for solutions? using tool
